#Introduction to variables
#write a code that outputs how many vacation weeks are taken and in what month

travel_month = None
#assign a variable

travel_month = "January"

number_of_weeks = 3

#assuming you've found out you have more vacation weeks than you initially thought
#reassign a variable
number_of_weeks = 5

#output the final statement
